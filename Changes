  - Create supplimental library that contains missing functions.  
    These are functions that are only present in the liburing.h file 
    that are marked as static inline.  This make sense in C since 
    their all small tiny functions that just make things more ergonomic 
    or help setup structs but we need them as real functions to help from perl.
  - Do some clean up of the dist.ini and bump it's revision of starter

  - Update to a preview of 0.8 of liburing, to get some of the 5.11 support.  Might not work but it contains lots of fixes since 0.7

  - Updated dist.ini for easier publishing
  - Moved the OS check to dist.ini instead of alienfile, should behave better now on cpantesters
