This module provides bindings for the C<libuing> C library, for
working with the io_uring Linux kernel subsystem.  This library is
only available or relavent for Linux, and will fail to install on
any other operating systems.

This library also requires a fairly new version of the Linux kernel
as of this writing.  I'd recommend at a minimum a 5.3 versioned kernel
or newer, due to features and support.

For the eventual IO::Async::Loop::IOUring module, a minimum kernel
version of 5.4 (likely 5.5) will also be needed and detected at install
time of that module.

See the L<github|https://github.com/axboe/liburing> project for liburing,
and the kernel L<documentation (pdf)|https://kernel.dk/io_uring.pdf> for io_uring documentation 
Also see L<Alien::Build::Manual::AlienUser> for usage.
